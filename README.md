### Installing dependencies
Uvicorn is the web server for fast api
```
pipenv install fastpi
pipenv install "uvicorn[standard]"
```

### Installing dependecies with just pip
Create the `requirements.tx` from the pipfile
```
pipenv requirements > requirements.txt
```


Then run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do these steps every time a new dependecy is installed through pipenv

### Running a FastAPi application
```
uvicorn <file_name_no_ext>:app --reload
```

Or

```
fastapi run <file_name_w_ext>
```

## Managing migrations

### Initializing alembic
The `package_name` is generally `alembic`

```
alembic init <package_name> 
```
This command will create the tables with the fields specified in the `models.py` file and create a bunch of files that are useful to use alembic

### Create a migration
After adding the column to the `models.py` file, run
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Descriptive message for the migration"
```

If the configuration in the `alembic/env.py` and the `alembic.ini` file is correct the added column should be autogenerated in the upgrade and downgrade methods for the migration.

### Run a migration
```
alembic upgrade <revision_number>
```

### Rollback a migration
```
alembic downgrade -1
```
